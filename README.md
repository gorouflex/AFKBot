Tutorial video later

### Cautions
**Before update please close AFKBot and backup your config file if need!**

While download and update the updater might stop respond but still working, please wait until it says **Update successfully!**

# Config

- The default config was `keys = ASWD` and `sleep = 3`, you can change by editing config file (Config/config.txt) or editing through the Setting window
- `keys` means the key the bot will press (ex: ASWD -> random press A,S,W,D button) and the `,` can also be a key to be pressed so don't fill like this `A,S,W,D` instead fill like this `ASWD`
